# Outlook

This tool offers the possibility to display energy and area related data of the region Anhalt-Bitterfeld-Wittenberg. Furthermore, the formatted data gives a precise representation of each region. Although the emphasis lies in showing the complex process of planning wind turbines considering the given framework, the tool provides an overview of the regional energy system. Additionally, it is possible to make a comparison between the self-edited energy system and the Status Quo.

To realize this project within the framework, specific aspects were initially left out and simplifications were made. The following points describe which aspects can be covered in possible extensions. It should be considered that the complexity of the tool increases with each new functionality. The objective is to present the information in a comprehensible way.

- In order to assess whether the self-designed energy system is sufficient to achieve the energy and climate policy goals, **future scenarios** could be implemented in which these target values are defined. In this way, different paths can be compared and an optimal solution for the region can be determined.

- The tool presents the **energy grid** in the current and future energy system. This includes the identification of transport routes that are particulary at risk from bottlenecks and, particulary the electrical cables. Therefore, it could contribute to the discussion of grid expansion and reinforcement.

- Battery Storages or Demand Side Management could be implemented as options to enhance the **flexibility**(Flexibility options). This could illustrate how, on the one hand, the actual self-supply of the region can be increased and, on the other hand, the electrical grid can be relieved.  

- As of now, the main focus is the electrical energy system. Further options to extend the tool could be the **sector coupling** which increases the interdependence as well as the inclusion of the heating sector through power-to-heat and the transport sector through electro mobility. Potential sysnergies between sectors can be highlighted, e.g. the use of excess wind power in the heating sector.

- At present, the technical and legal potentials for renewable generation are shown. A **cost analysis** can be integrated to compare the economic viability of different future energy systems.
