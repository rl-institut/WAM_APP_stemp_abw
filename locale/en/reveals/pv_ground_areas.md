# Ground-mounted photovoltaic plants <img src="../../static/stemp_abw/img/energy_icons/Stromerzeuger_Photovoltaik_technologieneutral.svg" alt="PVA" width="35">

With an installed capacity of 445 megawatts and a share of around 18 % 
of the region's electricity demand, ground-mounted photovoltaic 
plants are already making a decisive contribution by the end of 2017. Further
expansion is an important element on the way to a fully renewable energy 
supply, which must be balanced against the spatial and environmental impact.


## Potential areas

The potential areas are determined according to 
<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/eeg_2014/__37.html" target="_blank">§37 EEG</a> 
(2017) on the basis of the current support scheme. 
The following areas are taken into account:

1. **110 m strips along federal motorways and railways**
  
    A 110 m buffer zone around federal motorways and railways, 
    minus a 40 m zone around federal motorways.
    (<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fstrg/__9.html" target="_blank">§9 FStrG</a>)
    and 10 m zone for railways
    (<a href="https://www.erneuerbare-energien.de/EE/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/bmwi_de/bericht-eeg-4-solar.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4" target="_blank">ZSW</a>)
    is used. Furthermore, a width of 24 m (federal motorways) or 12 m (railways) 
    is assumed.
    
2. **Soils with low arable yield potential (soil quality)**
    
    Large potential areas can be found in agricultural areas. According to
    (<a href="https://www.zsw-bw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDFs/Aktuelles/2019/politischer-dialog-pv-freiflaechenanlagen-studie-333788.pdf" target="_blank">ZSW</a>),
    areas with low arable yield potential (soil quality) are used.
    For this purpose, the arable land and meadows from
    <a href="https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc2018" target="_blank">Corine Land Cover</a>
    are offset against the very and extremely low soil quality (<50) 
    according to the Soil Quality Rating of
    <a href="https://www.bgr.bund.de/DE/Themen/Boden/Ressourcenbewertung/Ertragspotential/Ertragspotential_node.html"         target="_blank">BGR</a>.
    
    According to the <a href="https://mule.sachsen-anhalt.de/fileadmin/Bibliothek/Politik_und_Verwaltung/MLU/MLU/04_Energie/Klimaschutz/00_Startseite_Klimaschutz/190205_Klima-_und_Energiekonzept_Sachsen-Anhalt.pdf" target="_blank">Klima- und Energiekonzept</a> (2019) (climate and energy concept)
    of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the current planning aims to avoid
    the construction of photovoltaic open-air plants on agricultural 
    land as far as possible.  
    To take this restriction into account, only **0.5 % of the resulting** 
    **areas (after deduction of the restriction areas, see below) are** 
    **assumed to be spatially compatible**  
    (<a href="https://www.zsw-bw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/PDFs/Aktuelles/2019/politischer-dialog-pv-freiflaechenanlagen-studie-333788.pdf" target="_blank">ZSW</a>).
        
Other sites included in the EEG's funding programme - conversion areas
and federal real estate - are not taken into account here due to the comparatively
low potential and lack of data availability.

## Restriction areas

In contrast to the potential areas, the installation of photovoltaic systems 
is excluded (hard) or unlikely (soft) in restriction areas. 
Both the current legal situation and the planning criteria were taken 
into account here
(see.
<a href="https://www.bbr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/Veroeffentlichungen/ministerien/BMVI/BMVIOnline/2015/DL_BMVI_Online_08_15.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2" target="_blank">BMVI</a>
). 

1. **Hard restrictions**
    - Settlement areas (+100 m buffer) 
    - Transport Routes
        - Federal motorways: (24 m width, +40 m buffer)
        - Federal, rural and district roads (+20 m buffer)
        - Side roads  (5 m width)
        - Railways (12 m width, +10 m buffer)
    - Railway facilities
    - Air traffic facilities
    - Waters, standing and flowing (+20 m buffer)
    - Forest (+100 m buffer)
    - Nature conservation areas
    - National Park (in ABW n.a.)
    - Biosphere reserves
    - Flood plains
    - Natural monuments with a large surface area
    - Water conservation areas
    - Hard restriction areas according to
    <a href="https://www.planungsregion-abw.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/REP-ABW_2018_Text.pdf" target="_blank">Regionalplan ABW 2018</a>
        - Priority areas for agriculture
        - Priority areas for raw material extraction
        - Important industrial and commercial locations in the state (existing + planned)
        - Region important location for industry and commerce (existing + planned)
    
2. **Soft restrictions**
    - FFH areas
    - SPA-/bird sanctuaries
    - Protected landscapes
    - Reserved areas for the development of an integrated ecological system
    - Priority areas for forestry
    - Nature parks
    - Priority areas for nature and landscape
    - Priority areas for water extraction
    - Reserved areas for tourism and recreation
    - UNESCO World Heritage Site (Gartenreich Dessau-Wörlitz)
    - Reserved areas for agriculture

## Boundary conditions

- For economic reasons, only areas >1 ha are taken into account.
- Existing plants and areas used for plants are neglected.
- For the specific area requirement, 2.5 hectares per installed megawatt (peak) 
  are assumed
  (<a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/B/berichtsmodul-2-modelle-und-modellverbund.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=6" target="_blank">BMWi</a>).

## Results

In order to determine the actually available areas, the restriction areas 
are subtracted from the potential areas. The following potentials result 
for areas and maximum installable capacity:

|                                         | Hard<br/>area [ha]<br/> | Hard<br/>Leistung [MWp] | Hard + Soft<br/>area [ha] | Hard+Soft<br/>Leistung [MWp] |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------:| -----------------------------:| -----------:| -----------------------------:|
| Bundesautobahn                          |       226,0 |                          90,4 |       138,0 |                          55,2 |
| Schienenwege                            |      1959,0 |                         783,6 |       963,0 |                         385,2 |
| Äcker und Wiesen mit geringer Bodengüte |      2267,6 |                         907,0 |       699,9 |                         280,0 |
| **Summe**                               |      4452,6 |                    **1781,0** |      1800,9 |                     **720,4** |

**The value displayed in the menu controller represents the maximum installable 
rated power with hard restriction areas.**.
